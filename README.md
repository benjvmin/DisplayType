# DisplayType
A responsive, flexbox based utility library for rapidly prototyping user interfaces. 

# Introduction
DisplayType aims to make creating responsive flexbox based components easier by providing a small layer of abstraction that focuses on the benefits of functional based CSS while integrating nicely with existing CSS methodologies such as BEM. DisplayType is primarily used best for projects that require a quicker development cycle, or projects that are dependant on prototyping in the browser. 

Since DisplayType lives somewhere between often conflicting CSS methodologies, it's primary goal is to broadly explore and seek to improve the way we think about and construct user interfaces by extracting the benefits of functional CSS while steering clear of muddling up your organized naming conventions.

# Basics
If you are already familiar with flexbox, learning the naming conventions for DisplayType's utilities is a breeze. Refer to the API below for a hard coded reference with descriptions.

1. Add a ```data-display-type``` attribute to elements you wish to apply display utilities to. 

2. Inside this special data attribute, add any corresponding display utility.

```html 
<header>
  <div class=""></div>
  <div class=""></div>
  <div class=""></div>
</header>
```
3. Refer to the API for all display combinations.
