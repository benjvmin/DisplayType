# DisplayType
A flexbox based utility library for rapidly prototyping user interfaces.



# Introduction
DisplayType aims to integrate well with existing and widely used CSS methodologies while extracting and applying benefits of a functional approach to CSS. DisplayType primarily exists at the intersection of (often conflicting) methodologies, in order to explore and seek to improve the way we think about and construct user interfaces. 


# Basics

1. Prepare to add utilities to html elements by adding a ```data-display-type``` attribute. 

2. Inside this special data attribute, add any corresponding display utility.

```html 
<nav>
  <ul data-display-type="d-f jc-c">
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Support</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Github</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
3. Refer to the API for all display combinations.
